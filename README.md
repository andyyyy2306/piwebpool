PLATFORM SETUP FROM SCRACTH
---------------------------------------------------------

You will find a script named setup.sh in the root directory, this script almost fully automates the installation of the application.
Some manual steps are however required. You are advise to make the installation on a fresh raspberry dedicated to the application.
Otherwise, have a look to the script before to make sure it doesn't break anything if you perform the setup on a productive raspberry 
already used for other need. 

1) Make sure your raspberry config is ok
    sudo raspi-config
         1-expand file system
         5-locale fr UTF 8
         5-timezone europe paris
         5-keyboard layout
             generic 105 - german french switzerland
         9-advanced - sethostname: piweb3
         9-advanced enable ssh
    apt-get install rpi-update
    rpi-update

2) setup wifi (optionnal)
    sudo vi /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
        country=FR                                                                                                                                              
        ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev                                                                                                 
        update_config=1                                                                                                                                         
        network={                                                                                                                                               
           ssid="ASUS_AP"                                                                                                                                       
           psk="jt2p9ug1"                                                                                                                                       
        } 

3) install adafruit webide (optional)        
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adafruit/Adafruit-WebIDE/alpha/scripts/install.sh | sudo sh
    goto http://your_raspberry_ip/config change port to 8090
    sudo service adafruit-webide.sh restart

4) run the piwebpool install script
    source setup.sh

5) check and modify the configuration with your setup:
    
    /etc/rc.local                                   :make sure rc.local is updated
    /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf                           :edit your service provider info
        root=postmaster
        mailhub=mail.gandi.net:587
        hostname=piweb
        AuthUser=admin@infrafast.com
        AuthPass=Quxxxxxxxx04
        UseSTARTTLS=YES    
        rewriteDomain=infrafast.com
        FromLineOverride=YES
    /etc/ssmtp/revaliases                           :edit your service provider info
        www-data:admin@infrafast.com:mail.gandi.net:587
    /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf   :make sure the documentroot point to piweb directory
